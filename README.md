## Installation

Download/Install the Package Manager for sublime text instructions here: [https://sublime.wbond.net/installation](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation)

Once it is installed, use Preferences->Package Manager in sublime, and use the command "Add Repository" It will require a URL. Simply use the url of this repository [https://github.com/aaronnech/monkey.sublime](https://github.com/aaronnech/monkey.sublime) WITHOUT the ".git".

Now enter the "Install Package" command and install monkey.sublime.

### Adding monkey to your PATH
There are two paths in Mac OS X, the $PATH used by Terminal/shells and the Environment PATH as used by Windowed apps.  
We'll add to both, just in case you need to use trans_macos from a shell as well as Sublime Text.

There is also the $PATH variable in most Linux systems that you will need to update.

This is how sublime will be able to find your Monkey executables and compile your application with the build tools. So you must add the Monkey executables to your $PATH variable. It essentially puts executables into the global scope of the terminal and allows sublime to execute them without knowing where they are stored on your computer.

#### Adding to the Terminal/shell $PATH
	
	In OSX, it is usually something along the lines of:
    echo "export PATH=\$PATH:/user/folder/monkey/bin" >> ~/.profile

    In Linux, you can edit your ~/.bashrc file and add the line:
    export PATH=/path/to/monkey/bin:${PATH}

#### Adding to the Environment PATH / Other things

You may need to do the following as well(in OSX):

Assuming you have done the step above, in Terminal:

    defaults write ${HOME}/.MacOSX/environment PATH "${PATH}"

Alternatively, you can manually edit `~/.MacOSX/environment.plist` or use the  [RCEnvironment](http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCEnvironment/) preference pane.  
Either way, the goal is to add your monkey/bin path to the PATH variable in your environment.

You will need to restart Mac OS X for the changes to take effect.

In Linux you may need need to type "source ~/.bashrc" to load in the changes; alternatively you can restart.
